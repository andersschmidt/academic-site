      <description>The summertime is upon us. Allright, in Denmark the summer has lasted for months already, which is very unusual. It kind of makes you think of Global Warming. During the summer I usual find some extra time to reflect on new learning goals in R, new packages to explore etc.
Last year, I attended the UseR! conference in Brussels, so the strait-forward strategy will be to browse through the overwhelming amout of videos and materials fra this years conference in Brisbane.</description>

      <description>On my way to design a third and fourth clinical trial I found it useful to reflect on the way the previous studies were designed and what considerations I have made. Randomized trials are only as good as they are designed - and important considerations must be made prior to the initiation of the project. Often recruitment of patients may last for years and therefore a careful plan is needed to enhance the scientific outcome of the study.</description>
