      <description>On my way to design a third and fourth clinical trial I found it useful to reflect on the way the previous studies were designed and what considerations I have made. Randomized trials are only as good as they are designed - and important considerations must be made prior to the initiation of the project. Often recruitment of patients may last for years and therefore a careful plan is needed to enhance the scientific outcome of the study.</description>
