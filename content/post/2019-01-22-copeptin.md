**Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: Can we predict success using copeptin?**

 The study aims to investigate if successful outcome after 
electrical direct current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation can be predicted 
based on the biomarker copeptin. Cardioversion is an important treatment 
option, which aims to reduce disease burden. However, cardioversion is 
not always successful, and recurrence of atrial fibrillation is present in 50-
80% of patients after one year. Copeptin is a novel biomarker associated 
with cardiovascular morbidity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between copeptin and outcomes after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. 

Patients undergoing elective cardioversion of atrial fibrillation 
were included. The level of copeptin was determined before 
cardioversion and at 90-day follow-up. The data are a post-hoc analysis of [a previous study](https://andersschmidt.netlify.com/publication/jaha-study/)

**Results**

In total, 116 patients were included of which 85 (73 %) were male. 
The baseline characteristics were not statistically significantly different between patients with 
successful or failed cardioversion outcome with the exception of the  left atrial volume, as patients with a successful cardioversion had a smaller left atrium size (p=0.03), a tendency that persisted after correction for 
the body surface area (indexed left atrial volume), p=0.05 (Table 1):

 Data on cardioversion outcome is presented in 
Table 2. Furthermore, as we have demonstrated in [a previous study](https://andersschmidt.netlify.com/publication/jaha-study/), the two defibrillators were of different efficacy, and accordingly, data on cardioversion outcome is reported stratified by defibrillator in Table 2. Data on the follow-up outcomes are presented in Table 3.

This study was an observational study on data collected from a randomized trial with a modest sample 
size. Our population consisted of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation with a longer-term duration and 
thus represents more severe cases of AF. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution in other 
AF populations. Copeptin levels vary slightly between genders in the general population. However, we did 
not stratify for gender in the study as the proportion of males and females were similar in patients with and 
without successful cardioversion. In the study we used simple stratification and comparison of biomarker levels; however, a binary regression model enabling adjustment for known confounders may be useful in further analyses.  

**Conclusions:**
Copeptin levels were not associated with the outcome after cardioverting atrial fibrillation. We also found no 
association  between  copeptin  levels  at  follow-up  in  patients  presenting  with  sinus  rhythm  and  atrial 
fibrillation respectively.
