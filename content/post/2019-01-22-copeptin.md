**Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: Can we predict success using copeptin?**

 The study aims to investigate if successful outcome after 
electrical direct current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation can be predicted 
based on the biomarker copeptin. Cardioversion is an important treatment 
option, which aims to reduce disease burden. However, cardioversion is 
not always successful, and recurrence of atrial fibrillation is present in 50-
80% of patients after one year. Copeptin is a novel biomarker associated 
with cardiovascular morbidity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between copeptin and outcomes after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. 

Patients undergoing elective cardioversion of atrial fibrillation 
were included. The level of copeptin was determined before 
cardioversion and at 90-day follow-up. The data are a post-hoc analysis of [a previous study](https://andersschmidt.netlify.com/publication/jaha-study/)
