The summertime is upon us. Allright, in Denmark the summer has lasted for months already, which is very unusual. It kind of makes you think of Global Warming. During the summer I usual find some extra time to reflect on new learning goals in R, new packages to explore etc. 

Last year, I attended the *UseR!* conference in Brussels, so the strait-forward strategy will be to browse through the overwhelming amout of videos and materials fra this years conference in [Brisbane](/user2018.r-project.org).
